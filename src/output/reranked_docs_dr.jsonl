B. Animals\nAnswer from: samanthagarcia16\nThe answer is b: animals\nAnimals\u2019 imagery was important to the Northwest coast tribes.

Answer from:", "Women collected bulbs, roots, berries, and seeds. Housing\nNorthwest Coast Indians lived in different places depending on the season. Groups spent the winter in several large houses. In the summer house groups would break up into smaller groups, which would move between good fishing and berry-picking sites. Summer was when they would process food for winter storage. Northwest Coast houses were made with wood from the forests, usually red cedar. All were rectangular and could be as long as 100 feet (30.5 meters). They built the framework of the houses with cedar posts and attached planks to form the walls and roof. These planks could be taken down, loaded onto canoes, and moved from one site to another. Most homes had a central fire pit.", "At about the same time, they also expanded within Alaska south to the Alaska Peninsula, where their southern limit coincided with that of heavy winter coastal drift ice and intruded in some limited areas to the North Pacific itself near Cook Inlet. Within a few centuries they moved also into the tundra-covered Barren Grounds west of Hudson Bay, displacing earlier peoples who had exploited Barren Grounds caribou. Along the northeastern coast of the continent, they penetrated southward as far as the Gulf of St. Lawrence, again to the southern edge of heavy winter sea ice. In northern Canada and Greenland the Small Tool folk gradually developed into those of the Dorset culture, who by 800 bc had created techniques for hunting seals through their breathing holes in winter sea ice and developed substantial dwellings of sod and rocks that they heated with lamps of sea-mammal oil. In some areas the Dorset culture is thought to have persisted until about ad 1300. Dorset ivory amulet\nStylized ivory amulet from the Dorset culture, found in Labrador or Quebec, Canada.

These people made pottery similar to that found in contemporary Siberia, and their substantial villages of semisubterranean houses appeared along the coast from the Bering Sea to the Beaufort Sea, near the present northern border of Alaska with Canada. Norton people hunted sea mammals in open water\u2014some of their harpoons were large enough for whaling\u2014as well as interior animals, including caribou; they also took lake and river fish.", "Please try again later.

A revival of traditional ceremonial ways also drove the increased production of traditional arts. This time also saw an increasing demand for the return of art objects that were illegally or immorally taken from First Nations communities. This demand continues to the present day. Today, there are numerous art schools teaching formal Northwest Coast art of various styles, and there is a growing market for new art in this style. The revival of ceremonial life, following the lifting of the potlatch ban - have also driven production of traditional clothing, painting and carving for use in ceremonies. Cultural appropriateness\nTommy Joseph, Tlingit woodcarver and sculptor from Sitka, Alaska\nAlthough neighbouring peoples such as the Coast Salish peoples also traditionally produced art which shares some characteristics of Northwest Coast art, these styles of art are not usually included in the term, since the patterns and artifacts produced are rather different. For example, Salish peoples traditionally created standing welcome figures not created by other Northwest Coast peoples, did not traditionally create totem poles, and did not traditionally use the form lines and shapes of other Northwest Coast peoples. One corollary of this fact is that \u2014 contrary to popular belief \u2014 other than some of the peoples of the Olympic Peninsula, no Native American nations of Washington and Oregon states produced totem poles and other characteristic, formline, Northwest Coast-style art objects before European contact. Traditionally, within a given community, some patterns and motifs could be used only by certain families and lineages, or with the agreement of those families and lineages."]}
