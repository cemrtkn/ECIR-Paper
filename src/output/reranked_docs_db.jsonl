Prior to contact, and for a brief time after colonisation, some of these groups regularly conducted war against each other through raids and attacks. Through warfare they gathered captives for slavery. The creation of beautiful and practical objects (for all tribal communities) served as a means of transmitting stories, history, wisdom and property from generation to generation. Art provided Indigenous people with a tie to the land by depicting their histories on totem poles the Big (Plank) Houses of the Pacific Northwest coast \u2013 the symbols depicted were a constant reminder of their birth places, lineages and nations. Due to the abundance of natural resources and the affluence of most Northwest tribes, there was plenty of leisure time to create art. Many works of art served practical purposes, such as clothing, tools, weapons of war and hunting, transportation, cooking, and shelter; but others were purely aesthetic. Spiritualism, the supernatural and the importance of the environment played integral roles in day-to-day life. Therefore, it was not unusual for their worldly goods to be adorned with symbols, crests and totems that represented some important figure (s) from both the seen and unseen worlds.", "At about the same time, they also expanded within Alaska south to the Alaska Peninsula, where their southern limit coincided with that of heavy winter coastal drift ice and intruded in some limited areas to the North Pacific itself near Cook Inlet. Within a few centuries they moved also into the tundra-covered Barren Grounds west of Hudson Bay, displacing earlier peoples who had exploited Barren Grounds caribou. Along the northeastern coast of the continent, they penetrated southward as far as the Gulf of St. Lawrence, again to the southern edge of heavy winter sea ice. In northern Canada and Greenland the Small Tool folk gradually developed into those of the Dorset culture, who by 800 bc had created techniques for hunting seals through their breathing holes in winter sea ice and developed substantial dwellings of sod and rocks that they heated with lamps of sea-mammal oil. In some areas the Dorset culture is thought to have persisted until about ad 1300. Dorset ivory amulet\nStylized ivory amulet from the Dorset culture, found in Labrador or Quebec, Canada. Courtesy of the Museum of the American Indian, New York City\nIn Alaska the material culture of the Small Tool people was replaced by that of the Norton culture in approximately 500 bc. These people made pottery similar to that found in contemporary Siberia, and their substantial villages of semisubterranean houses appeared along the coast from the Bering Sea to the Beaufort Sea, near the present northern border of Alaska with Canada. Norton people hunted sea mammals in open water\u2014some of their harpoons were large enough for whaling\u2014as well as interior animals, including caribou; they also took lake and river fish.", "Women collected bulbs, roots, berries, and seeds. Housing\nNorthwest Coast Indians lived in different places depending on the season. Groups spent the winter in several large houses. In the summer house groups would break up into smaller groups, which would move between good fishing and berry-picking sites. Summer was when they would process food for winter storage. Northwest Coast houses were made with wood from the forests, usually red cedar. All were rectangular and could be as long as 100 feet (30.5 meters). They built the framework of the houses with cedar posts and attached planks to form the walls and roof. These planks could be taken down, loaded onto canoes, and moved from one site to another. Most homes had a central fire pit."]}
