It may feel overwhelming to hear about an intense trauma so personal reactions are delayed as you focus on the task at hand. Listening to traumatic material can also trigger memories of your own previous traumas. Vicarious trauma is similar to direct trauma. It carries many of the same symptoms and can be treated in many of the same ways. Who Experiences Vicarious Trauma? If you are regularly hearing about another person\u2019s trauma, then you are at risk of developing vicarious trauma symptoms. This can include medical providers, law enforcement, mental health staff, social workers, and those working in the courts.

What is Vicarious Trauma? \u201cHow do you do this all day?\u201d How many times have we as helping professionals been asked this question only to respond with a look on our faces that hardly represents our true feelings? Unless, of course, you are talking with another person who has walked a mile in your shoes \u2013 anyone who serves as a \u201cgood ear\u201d - one who can empathize with your authentic response to that commonly asked question. Vicarious Trauma is defined as a transformation in the helper\u2019s inner sense of identity and existence that results from utilizing controlled empathy when listening to clients\u2019 trauma-content narratives. In other words, Vicarious Trauma is what happens to your neurological (or cognitive), physical, psychological, emotional and spiritual health when you listen to traumatic stories day after day or respond to traumatic situations while having to control your reaction .", "Vicarious Traumatization is the cumulative impact upon the therapist from working with clients who have suffered trauma. The therapist begins to personally suffer from engaging empathetically with the clients\u2019 trauma. Contrary to what some may believe, even therapists lack an endless reservoir of empathy to give without paying the price. At times, school psychologists work with students who threaten suicide or homicide. As it happens, most of the time, these dramatic ideations are never actualized. But the devoted therapist doesn\u2019t when they will and when they won\u2019t. In the meantime, there is a lot of worrying, which sometimes results in sleepless nights, fraught with anxiety about what might happen. There is a lesser-known source of burnout as well. Unlike being a gardener or surgeon, therapists rarely see immediate or even tangible results from all their hard work. In most cases, the work is slow and has its ups and downs.", "You must recognize that you are not alone in your pain. Often, treating Vicarious Trauma means learning how to take care of yourself again, through the body and the mind: Take care of your body. Make sure you\u2019re getting enough sleep, eating healthy, and exercising regularly\nBeing aware and mindful. Medicate time to engage in hobbies that make you feel good, practice mindfulness or yoga, and consider therapy. Allow yourself to be social. Get out and socialize with family, friends, and loved ones. Socializing is great fuel for the mind. Remember, treating your Vicarious Trauma may require taking some well-deserved time off work. So, don\u2019t be hesitant to do so!", "Herman, 1997; Webster & Webb, 2005)\nVicarious Trauma\nHistorical trauma is perpetuated and its process continues, as its fuel is the ongoing discrimination experienced by the living generations.

B. Animals\nAnswer from: samanthagarcia16\nThe answer is b: animals\nAnimals\u2019 imagery was important to the Northwest coast tribes. Explanation: Imagery is a literary term that is used for language and illustration that appeals to the sense of sight, smell, touch, hearing or taste. A writer uses imagery when he or she appeals to one\u2019s sense of sight, smell, touch, hearing or taste. Animal imagery is used when artist want to change people\u2019s perception about animals. Answer from:", "Women collected bulbs, roots, berries, and seeds. Housing\nNorthwest Coast Indians lived in different places depending on the season. Groups spent the winter in several large houses. In the summer house groups would break up into smaller groups, which would move between good fishing and berry-picking sites. Summer was when they would process food for winter storage. Northwest Coast houses were made with wood from the forests, usually red cedar. All were rectangular and could be as long as 100 feet (30.5 meters). They built the framework of the houses with cedar posts and attached planks to form the walls and roof. These planks could be taken down, loaded onto canoes, and moved from one site to another. Most homes had a central fire pit.", "At about the same time, they also expanded within Alaska south to the Alaska Peninsula, where their southern limit coincided with that of heavy winter coastal drift ice and intruded in some limited areas to the North Pacific itself near Cook Inlet. Within a few centuries they moved also into the tundra-covered Barren Grounds west of Hudson Bay, displacing earlier peoples who had exploited Barren Grounds caribou. Along the northeastern coast of the continent, they penetrated southward as far as the Gulf of St. Lawrence, again to the southern edge of heavy winter sea ice. In northern Canada and Greenland the Small Tool folk gradually developed into those of the Dorset culture, who by 800 bc had created techniques for hunting seals through their breathing holes in winter sea ice and developed substantial dwellings of sod and rocks that they heated with lamps of sea-mammal oil. In some areas the Dorset culture is thought to have persisted until about ad 1300. Dorset ivory amulet\nStylized ivory amulet from the Dorset culture, found in Labrador or Quebec, Canada. Courtesy of the Museum of the American Indian, New York City\nIn Alaska the material culture of the Small Tool people was replaced by that of the Norton culture in approximately 500 bc. These people made pottery similar to that found in contemporary Siberia, and their substantial villages of semisubterranean houses appeared along the coast from the Bering Sea to the Beaufort Sea, near the present northern border of Alaska with Canada. Norton people hunted sea mammals in open water\u2014some of their harpoons were large enough for whaling\u2014as well as interior animals, including caribou; they also took lake and river fish.", "But there are also blue herons, orcas, coyotes, cougars, otters, and so much more. If you keep your eyes open and always curious, there are so many animals all around us! Here are just some of the amazing wild animals that call the Northwest home: California Gray Whale\nRoughly the size of a bus, these whales are some of the world\u2019s greatest migrators and some make the 12,500 mile round trip from Alaska to Mexico. Gray whales are roughly 40-50 feet in length, weigh around 30-40 tons, and live in pods. Because they\u2019re covered in parasites and other organisms, they often look like a crusty ocean rock. Last spring (around March of 2018), gray whale sightings were actually up along the coasts of the northwest! This was in part because of the beautiful weather we had last spring (which resulted in more people out and about and noticing the whales) but according to the American Cetacean Society, there seems to be a population growth in some gray whale pods over the last couple years! Where It\u2019s Okay to Pet the Whales by Thomas P. Peschak, National Geographic\nOne great place to learn more about the gray whales that pass by the northwest and to potentially see some would be the Whale Watching Center in Depoe Bay, Oregon.

Totem poles are the most well-known artifacts produced using this style. Northwest Coast artists are also notable for producing characteristic \"bent-corner\" or \"bentwood\" boxes, masks, and canoes. Northwest Coast designs were also used to decorate traditional First Nations household items such as spoons, ladles, baskets, hats, and paddles; since European contact, the Northwest Coast art style has increasingly been used in gallery-oriented forms such as paintings, prints and sculptures. Mary Ebbets Hunt - Chilkat blanket\nAlthough highly conventionalized decorative design occurs all along the coast, to the south and north of this center the representational motive becomes progressively stronger. Krickeberg (1925: 144) characterizes this as a fresh naturalism to the south among the Kwakiutl, Nootka, and Salish and a certain relationship to Eskimo engraving and painting among the Tlingit to the north. The shift in emphasis is gradual - Bella Bella art, for example, has a close affinity to its Coast Tsimshian counterpart."]}
